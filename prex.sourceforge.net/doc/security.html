<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
As a recent tendency, security is becoming very important
in embedded systems design.
So, we identify security as a key goal and design component for Prex.
</p>
<p>
Prex supports installation and execution of the user applications by the end user.
This design has higher security risk compared with other RTOS that can execute
only pre-defined applications.
So, Prex provides system-wide security features to protect the system from
the threat.
</p>
<p>
This document describes the design and implementation of
the platform security of Prex.
</p>

<h2 id="model">Security Model</h2>

<h3>Prerequisite</h3>
<p>
To achieve the effective security described in this document, it requires MMU support
in the system. It's because we have to use separate memory space for the kernel and
each user mode application.
</p>

<h3>Unit of Trust</h3>
<p>
Unlike generic desktop OS used on PC, Prex is designed for a single user
(We can not assume that the user "login" to the Phone or MP3 player at every power-on).

So, the task is unit of trust with Prex.
The system designer can manage the security permission of each task.
</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<p>
The key security features of Prex are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Task Capabilities</li>
  <li>File Access Control</li>
  <li>Secure Servers</li>
  <li>Protected Device</li>
  <li>Resource Limits</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="cap">Task Capabilities</h2>

<p>
Prex supports a security framework named "capability" which was derived from
POSIX.1e capabilities.

Each task will have its own capabilities for various operations.
When a task tries to do a privileged operation, the
kernel, device drivers and system servers
will check the appropriate bit in the task's capability.
</p>

<h3>Types of Capability</h3>
<p>
The type of capability is unsigned 32-bit integer.
So, we can define 32 types of capabilities in the maximum.
</p>
<pre>
typedef uint32_t	cap_t;
</pre>

<p>
The system defines the following capabilities:
</p>

<table border="1" width="70%" cellspacing="0">

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


<h3>Capability Assignment</h3>

<p>
The task's capabilities are set in the following two conditions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot: The default capability sets are assigned to boot tasks by the kernel at system boot.</li>
  <li>Runtime: Appropriate capabilities are set by the exec server from the pre-defined security policy.</li>
</ol>



<p>
The kernel provides the following APIs to control task's capability.
</p>

<pre>
int task_setcap(task_t task, cap_t cap);
int task_chkcap(task_t task, cap_t cap);
</pre>

<p>
task_setcap() function can be used only by the task which has CAP_SETPCAP capability.
So, CAP_SETPCAP capability is set to the exec server by the kernel at boot.
</p>



<h3>Kernel API</h3>

<p>
The kernel checks whether the task has an appropriate capability
to call the specific kernel API.
If the caller task does not have the proper capability, the kernel
will reject the request with EPERM error.
</p>

<p>
task_capable() in task.c is used to check whether the current task has
the specific capability.
</p>
<pre>
int
task_capable(cap_t cap)
{
        int capable = 1;

        if ((curtask->capability & cap) == 0) {
                DPRINTF(("Denying capability by kernel: task=%s cap=%08x\n",
                         curtask->name, cap));
                if (curtask->flags & TF_AUDIT)
                        panic("audit failed");
                capable = 0;
        }
        return capable;
}
</pre>

<p>
vm_map() kernel API requires CAP_EXTMEM because a malicious task can
access to other task's memory space by using this API.
</p>

<pre>
int
vm_map(task_t target, void *addr, size_t size, void **alloc)
{
        int error;

        sched_lock();
        if (!task_valid(target)) {
                sched_unlock();
                return ESRCH;
        }
        if (target == curtask) {
                sched_unlock();
                return EINVAL;
        }
        if (!task_capable(CAP_EXTMEM)) {
                sched_unlock();
                return EPERM;
        }

        ...
}
</pre>



<h3>Security Auditing</h3>

<p>
To enable security auditing, the following option should be enabled in the
configuration file.
</p>

<pre>
options 	AUDIT		# Security auditing
</pre>

<p>
When the audit option is enabled, the kernel marks the audit flag
for all tasks. In this condition, the kernel will log the event for
all capability violation. This is useful for platform builders
to adjust the security policy.
</p>




<h2 id="file">File Access Control</h2>

<h3>Pre-defined Directories</h3>

<p>
Prex supports the file access permission based on the path
name. It means that the applications have access to only
certain area of the file system.
</p>
<p>
The file system has the following structure:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>/boot</dt>
<dd>
This directory contains the server executable files and
the system files like a splash screen image. Reading this
directory is allowed only to the server process which has
CAP_SYSFILES capability.
Nobody can write to this directory at any time.
</dd>

<dt>/private</dt>
<dd>
This is the restricted system area and is inaccessible to
the normal processes. It contains private user data like
passwords or security settings. CAP_ALLFILES capability is
required to access to the /private contents.
</dd>

<dt>/bin</dt>
<dd>
This directory contains the trusted applications.  This
is read-only directory for normal processes, and
CAP_ALLFILES is required to write files to it. In typical
case, a software installer has right to copy the
executable files to this directory.
</dd>

<dt>/etc</dt>
<dd>
This directory contains the various configuration files.
This is read-only for normal processes, and CAP_CFGFILES
is required to modify /etc. The system configurator will
modify the contents in /etc, or all application can modify
it only when the system boots with recovery mode.
</dd>

<dt>/all the rest</dt>
<dd>
Access to all the other directories is unrestricted.
</dd>
</dl>

<table border="1" width="90%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 2. Directories and required capabilities</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>Directory</th>
  <th>Read</th>
  <th>Write</th>
  <th>Execute</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>/boot</td>
  <td>CAP_SYSFILES</td>
  <td>Not Allowed</td>
  <td>Any</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>/private</td>

  <td>Not Allowed</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>/other</td>
  <td>Any</td>
  <td>Any</td>
  <td>Not Allowed</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>File Access Example</h3>

<p>
The following is a sample to test copying a file to /etc directory without
CAP_SYSFILES capability.
</p>

<pre class="terminal">
[prex:/etc]# ls
rc        fstab
[prex:/etc]# cat rc
PATH=/boot:/bin
HOME=/
export HOME PATH
uname -msr
mem
date
exec sh
[prex:/etc]# cp rc rc.2
Denying capability by fs: task=cp cap=00000800
Kernel panic: audit failed
</pre>

<p>
* The audit option is enabled for kernel with this example.
</p>

<h2 id="io">I/O Access Control</h2>

<h3>Raw I/O Access</h3>
<p>
The raw I/O access is allowed only to the task which has CAP_RAWIO capability.
This means that device_open() kernel call will be failed with EPERM error
for the unauthorized process.
</p>
<p>
The CAP_RAWIO capability is usually assigned to all real-time tasks, and it
is not set to the Unix process.
So, the Unix process must access the device via the device file under /dev.
The POSIX open() call will transfer the I/O request to the file system server
, and then, the file system server will invoke device I/O kernel call.
</p>

<h3>Protected Device</h3>
<p>
The device driver can set the protected flag (D_PROT) for the device object.
If the device object is marked as protected, the file system server will reject the
I/O request to such devices.
It means that the application can not access the protected devices via
Unix I/O calls.
If the application has CAP_RAWIO capability, it still can access the
protected device directly via kernel API.
</p>

<p>
For example, a ram disk driver should be protected for normal tasks because
only a file server can use it.
So, the ram disk driver will create the device object with D_PROT flag as follows.
</p>

<pre>
static int
ramdisk_init(struct driver *self)
{
        device_t dev;

        dev = device_create(self, "ram0", D_BLK|D_PROT);

        ...
}
</pre>

<p>
With this example, the device object for the ram disk can not be opened
with open() system call.
</p>

<p>
The protected flag will be marked as 'P' with 'device' command in the kernel debugger.
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<h2 id="pol">Security Policy</h2>


<h3>Default Capability Set</h3>

<p>
The system has static capability set which is assigned for the boot tasks
by kernel at system boot.
The default capability set is defined in the file /include/sys/capability.h.
</p>

<pre>
#define CAPSET_BOOT	0x00000043	/* capabilities for boot tasks */
</pre>


<p>
Note: This definition should be customized in the configuration file.
</p>

<h3>Capability Binding</h3>

<p>
When the exec server executes the user application,
it will assign the capabilities defined in the capability table.
The capability table is defined in the configuration file (/conf/etc/security),
and the actual table is built at the OS compile time.
So, we have to re-compile the system to change the security policy.

</p>

<pre>

<p><i>
* Note: Do not set CAP_SETPCAP capability except the exec server in the
security policy.
</i></p>



<h2 id="serv">Secure Servers</h2>

<h3>Protected Object</h3>
<p>
The object name started with '!' means that it is a protected object.
The protected object can be created only by the task which has
CAP_PROTSERV capability. Since this capability is given to the known
system servers, the client task can always trust the object owner.
</p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="Protected Objects" src="img/protobj.gif" border="1"
style="width: 465px; height: 337px;"><br>
Figure 1. Protected Objects
</p>

<h3>Checking Client's Capability</h3>
<p>
The server task will have some capabilities to execute various privileged
 operations requested by client tasks.
Therefore, the server should refuse the request of the client when the client does not
have the right to the operation.
</p>

<p>
The system server must call the task_chkcap() to check the client task's right
to send the specific IPC message. For this purpose, the kernel stores the
client's task ID in each IPC message header. Thus, the server can always
get the correct task ID of the client task.
</p>

<pre>
struct msg_header {
        task_t  task;           /* id of send task */
        int     code;           /* message code */
        int     status;         /* return status */
};
</pre>

<p>
For example, the power sever always checks whether the client task has
CAP_POWERMGMT capability. This is because the power management operation such like shutdown
is privileged operation and should be limited only to the power management utility (pmctrl).
</p>

<p>
Figure 2 shows the capability check for shutdown operation.
</p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="Capability Check" src="img/capability.gif" border="1"
style="width: 539px; height: 384px;"><br>
Figure 2. Capability Check for Shutdown
</p>

<p>
The following is a sample code to check the capability of the client task.
</p>
<pre>
/*
 * Main routine for power server.
 */
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        (snip)

        /*
         * Message loop
         */
        for (;;) {
                /* Wait for an incoming request. */
                error = msg_receive(obj, &amp;msg, sizeof(msg));
                if (error)
                        continue;

                /* Check client's capability. */
                if (task_chkcap(msg.hdr.task, CAP_POWERMGMT) != 0) {
                        map = NULL;
                        error = EPERM;
                }
        ...
}
</pre>


<h2 id="other">Other Security Features</h2>

<h3>Resource Limits</h3>

<p>
The kernel and system servers will limit the maximum count of the resource
to create. This will prevent the DoS (Denial of Service) attack by
malicious applications.
</p>

<h3>Software Installer</h3>

<p>
The software installer has CAP_SYSFILES capability to copy the
applications into the /bin and /etc directories.
It always requests user confirmation before installing software.
