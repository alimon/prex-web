<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Prex is designed to be used with battery-powered devices,
such as mobile phones or consumer electronics devices.

So, Prex provides an integrated and system-wide set of
power management features. It helps to extend
battery life, save energy and reduce heat and noise.
</p>
<p>
This document describes the design and implementation of the
power management features of Prex.
</p>


<h2 id="arch">Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>
The following components work together for power management in Prex.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>PM Utility:</b> handles the user's power management request.</li>
  <li><b>Power Server:</b> maintains the power policy and maps each power event to the power action.</li>
  <li><b>PM Driver:</b> controls the power state and power management timers.</li>
  <li><b>HAL:</b> controls the platform/architecture dependent hardware.</li>
  <li><b>Idle Thread:</b> works to cut needless power when the system is in idle.</li>
  <li><b>CPU Driver:</b> has responsible to control frequency/voltage of the processor.</li>
  <li><b>Device Drivers:</b> has responsible to adjust power of each device.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="syspm">System Power Management</h2>

<h3>Power States</h3>
<p>
Prex supports the following power states.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Power On</b></li>
  <li><b>Suspend</b> </li>
  <li><b>Power Off</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
In the suspend state, the system powers down devices that are not needed in order to safe
electricity, e.g. it may switch the monitor, sound card or modem off and
turn them back on when the system returns from the suspend state.
</p>


<h3>Power Management Timer</h3>
<p>
Prex provides the power management timer which sets the system to the suspend
state after a period of inactivity.
If a device driver detects some user activities (e.g. keyboard input),
the driver should notify it to the PM driver by using
pm_notify() function to reload the PM timer.
</p>
<p>
LCD off timer is also provided by PM driver, and LCD driver can support
automatic LCD off if it has the h/w capability.
</p>


<h3>Power Policy</h3>
<p>
The Power Server maintains a system-wide policy setting for its power operations.
A user application can change the power policy appropriately for the
user environment. Prex supports the following two power policies.
</p>

<table border="1" width="90%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 1. Power Policy</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>PM Policy</th>
  <th>Frequency/Voltage Control</th>
  <th>Suspend Timer</th>
  <th>LCD Off Timer</th>
  <th>Device Performance</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PM_POWERSAVE</td>
  <td>Adaptive</td>
  <td>Active</td>
  <td>Active</td>
  <td>Full</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PM_PERFORMANCE</td>
  <td>Max Level</td>
  <td>Frozen</td>
  <td>Frozen</td>
  <td>Adaptive</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


<h2 id="serv">Power Server</h2>
<p>
Power Server maintains the power policy that maps each power event to the power action.
</p>

<p>
The power server always monitors the power events sent from PM driver.
The default power actions are listed in the following table.
</p>

<table border="1" width="60%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 2. Default Power Actions</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>Power Event</th>
  <th>Power Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PME_PWRBTN_PRESS</td>
  <td>PWR_OFF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PME_LOW_BATTERY</td>
  <td>PWR_SUSPEND</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PME_SLPBTN_PRESS</td>
  <td>PWR_SUSPEND</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>PME_LCD_CLOSE</td>
  <td>PWR_OFF</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>





<h2 id="pmdrv">PM Driver Interface</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h3>PM I/O Control</h3>
<p>
IOCTL functions manipulate the power state and power policy used by
the PM driver. It also handles the request for the suspend timer.
</p>

<table border="1" width="80%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 3. PM I/O Controls</caption>

</tr>
<tr>

  <td>Timeout time</td>
  <td>Get dim timer</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


<h3>PM Device Control</h3>
<p>
Each device driver can receive the power management event sent by
the PM driver.

<table border="1" width="80%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 4. PM Device Control</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>Code</th>
  <th>Parameter</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DEVCTL_PM_POWERDOWN</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>Set to low power mode</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DEVCTL_PM_POWERUP</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>Set to normal power mode</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DEVCTL_PM_CHGPOLICY</td>
  <td>Power policy</td>
  <td>Change power policy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DEVCTL_PM_LCDOFF</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>Power off LCD</td>
</tr>
 <tr>
  <td>DEVCTL_PM_LCDON</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>Power on LCD</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The device drivers should monitor PM events by using devctl() methods.
And, when the driver receives DEVCTL_PM_POWERDOWN, it should program the device
to different power mode to conserve total system power.
</p>

<pre>
int
XXX_devctl(device_t dev, u_long cmd, void *arg)
{

        switch (cmd) {
        case DEVCTL_PM_POWERDOWN:
                /* Program device to low power state. */
                break;
        case DEVCTL_PM_POWERUP:
                /* Program device to normal power state. */
                break;
        }
        return 0;
}
</pre>



<h3>PM Driver Service</h3>
<p>
Each device driver can use the following PM services.
</p>

<pre>
void    pm_notify(int event);
int     pm_set_power(int);
void    pm_attach_lcd(device_t dev);
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>pm_notify()</dt>
<dd>
Notify the power event.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>pm_set_power()</dt>
<dd>
Set the system power state.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>pm_attach_lcd()</dt>
<dd>
Attach a device as LCD device. PM driver will call devctl routine of
the attached device with DEVCTL_PM_LCDOFF or DEVCTL_PM_LCDON.
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Idle Thread</h2>
<p>
The idle thread works as a kernel thread, and it is assigned the lowest scheduling priority in the system.
Thus, the idle thread runs when no other thread is active.
It has the role of cutting down the power consumption of the system.
</p>
<p>
An idle thread is just a forever-loop to call the machine
dependent routine to cut power. The following thread_idle() routine
is called at the end of the kernel initialization.
</p>
<pre>
void
thread_idle(void)
{

        for (;;) {
                machine_idle();
                sched_yield();
        }
}
</pre>
<p>
The machine_idle() routine will program the platform H/W to
the low power mode. This is typically
invoking the power saving (halt) instruction
supported by the processor.
If any interrupts are occurred in this low power mode, it must be returned
immediately from machine_idle(). Then, the idle thread will
call sched_yield() to check the re-scheduling.
</p>


<h2 id="reset">System Shutdown</h2>
<p>
When the PM driver receives a reset request from users or drivers,
 it will call machine_reset()
service in the microkernel.
Or, the microkernel may reset the system by itself if it finds an unrecoverable error.
</p>

<p>
The following figure illustrates the control flow of shutdown by power button press.
</p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="Shutdown Flow" src="img/shutdown.gif" border="1"
style="width: 514px; height: 355px;"><br>
Figure 2. Shutdown Flow
</p>

<ol>

<li>
 If power button driver detects the user's power button press,
it will notify the event to pm driver by pm_notify().
</li>

<li>
PM driver sends a power signal (SIGPWR) to the power server.
</li>

<li>
Power server translates the power button event to the
system power down.
It will send IPC message (STD_SHUTDOWN) to other system servers.
So, the system servers can do some jobs for the shutdown.
</li>

<li>
Power server requests the power down to the PM driver by using
I/O control message (PMIOC_SET_POWER).
</li>

<li>
PM driver will broadcast a power down control message
(DEVCTL_PM_POWERDOWN) for all
device drivers. A device driver can prepare for the shutdown by
monitoring this driver message.
</li>

<li>
PM driver calls HAL interface (machine_shutdown()) to set the system
off.
</li>

</ol>


<h2 id="cpupm">Processor Power Management</h2>

<h3>Dynamic Voltage Scaling</h3>
<p>
Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is widely used with mobile systems to save the processor
power consumption, with minimum impact on performance.
The basic idea is come from the fact the power consumption is
proportional to V^2 x f, where V is voltage and f is frequency.
Since processor does not always require the full performance,
we can reduce power consumption by lowering voltage and frequency.
</p>
<p>
The following figure shows how the system executes tasks with lower power consumption.
</p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="DVS logic" src="img/dvs.gif" border="1"
style="width: 656px; height: 200px;"><br>
Figure 3. DVS Control
</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<h4>Adjusting CPU Speed</h4>

<p>
We use the DVS algorithm known as Weiser Style [1].
If the utilization prediction x is high (over 70%), increase the
speed by 20% of the maximum speed. If the utilization prediction
is low (under 50%), decrease the speed by (60 - x)% of the
maximum speed.
</p>

<p>
DVS Algorithm: <b>Weiser Style</b>
</p>

<pre>
run_cycles += excess_cycles;
run_percent = (run_cycles * 100) / (idle_cycles + run_cycles);

next_excess = run_cycles - speed * (run_cycles + idle_cycles) / 100;
if (next_excess < 0)
        next_excess = 0;

if (excess_cycles > idle_cycles)
        newspeed = 100;
else if (run_percent > 70)
        newspeed = speed + 20;
else if (run_percent < 50)
        newspeed = speed - (60 - run_percent);

if (newspeed > max_speed)
        newspeed = max_speed;
if (newspeed < min_speed)
        newspeed = min_speed;

excess_cycles = next_excess;
</pre>

<p>
excess_cycles is defined as the number of uncompleted run cycles
from the last interval. For example, if we find 70% activity
when running at full speed, and their processor speed was set to
50% during that interval, excess_cycles is set to 20%. This
value (20%) is used to calculate the processor speed in the next
interval.
</p>


<h4>Max CPU Speed</h4>


<p>
The PM driver adjusts max CPU speed by using DVS algorithm called AVG<3> [2].
It computes an exponentially moving average of the previous intervals.
"weight" is the relative weighting of past intervals relative to
the current interval.
</p>
DVS Algorithm: <b>AVG<3></b>

<pre>
predict = (weight x current + past) / (weight + 1)
</pre>



<h3>Processor Driver Interface</h3>


<h4>CPU I/O Control</h4>
<p>
IOCTL functions for CPU frequency control are as follows:
</p>

<table border="1" width="80%" cellspacing="0">
<caption>Table 5. CPU Frequency I/O Controls</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <th>Code</th>
  <th>Parameter</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>CFIOC_GET_INFO</td>
  <td>struct cpufreqinfo</td>
  <td>Get CPU frequency information</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
CPU requency information structure:
</p>
<pre>
struct cpufreqinfo {
        int     maxfreq;        /* max speed in MHz */
        int     maxvolts;       /* max power in mV */
        int     freq;           /* current speed in MHz */
        int     volts;          /* current power in mV */
};
</pre>



<h4>Performance Control Services</h4>
<p>
If the target processor supports performance control,
the CPU driver can export the following operations to utilize it.
</p>

<pre>
struct cpufreq_ops {
	int	(*setperf)(int speed);
	int	(*getperf)(void);
	void	(*getinfo)(struct cpufreqinfo *info);
};
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>cpu_setperf()</dt>
<dd>
Set the processor performance level.
The argument is percent of CPU speed (0-100).
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>cpu_getperf()</dt>
<dd>
Get the current performance level.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>cpu_getinfo()</dt>
<dd>
Get the processor information.
</dd>
</dl>
